Two types of decomposition in software world.
1. OO decomposition. (Object Oriented)
2. AA decomposition. (Algorithmic or Arithmetic)

1.Object Oriented Decomposition-

- Distribute functionality to autonomous agents caleed objects.
- Object Should have their own data and operations to be performed on data to run it.
- Objects send messages to other objects to get their work done.(Onject Collaboration)
- Objects need references of other objects to pass messages.

2. Algorithmic Or Arithmetic Decomposition-
- functionaliyt of a application is split into several functional units.
- and organize them in an sequential occurence.(i.e order of execution).
