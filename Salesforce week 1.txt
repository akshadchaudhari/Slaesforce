What is cloud computing?
--> It is leveraging the power and reach of the internet.
-->to Deliver 3 categaories of services
   1. IAAS - Infrastructur As A Service eg)EC2,S3 Services in AWS 
   2. SAAS - Software As A Service eg) Provided by Google like presentation app,Salesforce Clouds.
   3. PAAS - Platform As A Service eg) Salesforce,force.com

These all services are interdependent on each other.

What is Salesforce?
-->World's No.1 CRM - Customer Relationship Management Platform. 
  and application development platform.

MVC Architecture used in salesforce.
M - Data model
V - View (User interface)
C - Controller (Business Logic)

Data models are created in:
1. Backend database.
2. On Salesforce by configuring Objects.

SOQL --> Salesforce DML language.
and apex DML statements we use.

Salesforce does not allow us to do more than 150 DML statements in a single  transaction.(called governer limit)
Multi-tenant Architecture - An Architecture in which resources are shared among all entities present in that Architecture.
eg) A server which can run multiple single software instances on it by sharing resources among them.   

Bulk DML Operation - which updates a list of records at once. 

What is an Org?
--> It is a collection of data,metadata and configurations used for building,deploying and hosting applications on the Salesforce platform.
Its Editions are:
 ->Performance
 ->Unlimited
 ->Developer(DE) -->free of cost 
 ->Database
 ->Enterprise

UI/UX --- User Interface / User Experience 
 1. Lightening Experience 
 2. Classic Experience

Field Label - It is the column name in a table.  -->Accounts. Visible On UI.
Field Name  - It is the column name in a table associated with an entity.-->Accounts Name "here Name is the field name"
 "and Accounts is the field label".(API Name used for accessing things in object during coding)
So whenever doing operations like writing query,etc Always use API Name.
In case of Standard objects the API Name and Field label are same.

Custom fields/objects have an API name with suffix '__c' and API Names cannot have space in between words.
Reuse Standard objects by adding custom fields to these objects.

What is a Record?
--> Is same as row in a table.

Customising Custom Objects - 

- In Salesforce entity is translated into object. 
- Standard fields like 'Name' is by default their we cannot remove it.
- Status of an object is set to 'deployed' if we want it to deploy to another org.(customer org -->live org)
most of the time the object should be in deployed status to do useful things.
- Objects created are available to all the apps on the org. 

- Formula field

--> Is a read only field which  value is calculated automatically.
--> Cross-object formula - It is a formula field which tries to access value of a field which is present in differnet object.(i.e inheriting from parent use formula field).

- Validation Rule 

--> is used to ensure legal and correct data entry while creating/updating records.
--> if any complex logic is required is written in front end.

We cannot make Tabs for Standard objects but we can do minor changes to them.

================================================================================================================================================================

Relationships
   one-to-many
   many-to-one
   one-to-one
   many-to-many

Relationships between onjects in Salesforce
   Master-Detail
   Lookup

For any relationship there is a parent/master (one) side and child/detail (many) side
In Salesforce the relationship field is always created on the child/detail/many side.i.e configure relationship on child side.  

- Lookup Relationship [Loosely Coupled Relationship]

--> In this relationship we may or may not associate the child record with the parent then also we can save the record.
--> The owner of the parent record and the child record can be different users.
--> No impact of Any DML operations.i.e If we delete a record from parent then record associated with it in child will not get deleted automatically 
but their relationship field will get nullified..

- Master-Deatil Relationship [Tightly Coupled Relationship]

--> In this relationship we have to associate the child record with the parent than only we can save the record.
--> Owner - User in the Org.
--> The owner of the parent record is also the owner of the child records.
--> A Standard object cannot be on the child side of a Master-Detail Relationship.
--> Some DML operations like DELETE will cascade from parent to child. i.e If we delete a record from parent then
 record associated with it in child will also get deleted automatically.
--> An object can have maximum of 2 Master-Detail relationships.
--> In case of 2 Master-Detail relationship; the first relationship is considered the primary relationship.

- Junction Object 

--> Are commonly used to represent many-to-many relationships.[Used to connect two objects]
--> Is considered to be an object with 2 Master-Detail relationships.

- Rollup Summary

--> Is a field that is created on the parent/master object.
--> Is a field created in your custom objects only if the relationship is Master-Deatil.
--> There are some standard objects that support this field even though the relationship is Lookup.(Only Applies to Standard Objects).
Eg) Account,opportunity,etc.
--> Summarized Object --> Child Object.

- If we are confused about relationship? choose a lookup relationship.

- Hirarchical Relationships

--> Are supported only in User Satndard Object.
--> Usecase is i am employee of persistent systems and use PI and access all things on PI.

- Self Relationships

--> Is a flavour of lookup relationship wherein an object can be related to itself. 
--> Usecase is heplfull in associating bug records with itself.

Case --> complaint/issue/ticket.

--> Salesforce has no striaght way to represent one-to-one relationship.
--> Many-to-many relationships are represented by Junction Object.

- SCHEMA BUILDER  is a tool used to visualize graphically the objects we have created.

- In Salesforce custom relationship fields have an API Name suffixed with '__r'. 

==========================================================================================================================

- Converting Relationships 

  -->Convert Lookup Into Master-Detail Relationship
     --> Existing Child records must be associated with a parent record. 
  -->Converting Master-Detail Into Lookup Relationship
     --> No Rollup Summaries in the master/parent.(i.e Delete the Rollup Summary field permanently(from recycle bin also)).

- Record ID
 
 --> Is a 18 character case sensitive alphanumeric string automatically generated by Salesforce.
 --> Is unique across salesforce.com.
 --> Is used to uniquely identify a record.
 --> It is stored in a field which has an API name Id.(We can it in URL)

- GLobal Value For Picklist Value Set

 --> Choose Global value set (but we first have to define global value set--> Quick search for Global value set and define it).

- Field dependencies/Dependency Fields

 --> eg) Countries and cities - if we want if someone selects country - india ,it should show cities related to india only and not other counteries we have configured in globally,etc.
     Then Countries is the 'controller field' and Cities is the 'dependency field'.

- Record Type

 --> Helps us to categorize records of an object.
 --> When we want to display different UI for Different Users we need to configure Record type field.
 --> In Salesforce, Tables -> object and Columns -> Fields.
 --> For different record we will show different Layouts(UIs) to the User.(By going to Page Layout Assisgnment)
 --> We can customize picklist of records also.

- What are Accounts?
--> Customer (Kotak)
--> Partner  (Salesforce)

- To Create Lightining App

--> Use App Manager (Serach it in quick search)
--> Utility item - The bar present at the bottom of the App or Browser.

- Tab,List View and Lightining Experience App are a part of configuring UI.

============================================================================================================================

- Record Detail Page
 
 --> It shows us the Record full information.

- Related List

 --> It shows us the whether the object has relationships with some other objects or not.

- Layouts
 
 --> Page Layout [Large Screen]
  -> Quick Save - Like Crtl+S and Save - Saves And Closes and goes to page layout section.
  -> Different User can get to see Different UIs through Page Layout Assignment.

 --> Comapact Layout [Mobile/Small Screen]
  -> It is the layout which renders the records on Mobile Phone. i.e For rendering on mobile phones compact layout is used.

- Object Specific Actions 

 --> Go to Button Links and Actions to create them.

- Global Actions

 --> They are present in the plus icon on the Home Tab.
 --> To Add the Action Button to Global Action list  , go to publisher layout.

- Lookup Filter

 --> It filters records visible in a relationship field.
 --> Can be applied on lookup and Master-detail relationship.
 --> eg) we can filter and show only active users in the borrow this book button.

- Email Templates

 --> To create email templates search email templates have to stored in folder so we can share the folder.
{!Campaign.Name} --- {!API name of object.API name of field}
   --> Merge Filed Sytax
