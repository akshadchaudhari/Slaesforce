- Security

 ---> User License
   --> Every user has exactly 1 user license
   --> System Admin has Salesforce license(Full CRM License) which enable him to do anything on CRM platform(Salesforce).
   Full CRM License - Can do anything on saleforce and accessibility. 
 ---> Permission Set License
   --> We have to assign.
 ---> Feature License
   --> Gets automatically assigned to the Users(by enabling certain options like marking,etc).No way to assign.
To see Licenses go to Company Information/Users

 ---> Profile [For giving access to user,etc]
   --> Every User License has 1 or more profile(s)
   --> Every User has exactly 1 profile
   --> Is used to configure access to apps,tabs,objects,fields,record types,page layouts,etc.
   --> 1 profile can have many Users.
   eg) we can give these profiles to a team so when a change is done it is reflected to everyone profile.
   --> Create Profile then Create User.
   Freeze - Blocks user from loging into org but license is not released.
   Deactivate - Releases the license of user.

NOTE:- Profile Level Configurations are visible to everyone.

---> An option which is used to bypass or override the sharing configurations is view all/modify all.
---> Configuration that allows a user to bypass or override all the sharing configurations in the Org is view all data/modify all data.
- Object Level Security
 
 ---> Configuring it at profile Level.
   --> page layout is editable through 2 ways 1. in profile 2. in page layout tab.
   --> granting permission to perform CRUD opeartions on a object.

- Field Level Security

 ---> Configuring it at profile Level.
 ---> Granting permission to read  and edit a field in an object'

- Record Level Security

 --->eg) Only i should be able to see my salary records and not anyone else.
 

- Permission Sets [For specific granting / To Overcome Profile Configuring Drawback](Used for object level and field level configurations)

 ---> Is used to grant additional access over and above a profile Level
 ---> You cannot withdrawn access through Permission Sets
 ---> First select permissions to be granted and then select the users to grant access.
   
- Process Automation
=====================================================================================================================

- Record Level Security

 --->eg) Only i should be able to see my salary records and not anyone else.
 ---> Four level of record level security
  1. Organization Wide Deafults [Users excluding the System Admin]              ^
  2. Role Hierarchy                                                             |
  3. Sharing Rules                                                              | Visbility(Access) Opens Up 
  4. Manual Sharing                                                             | 

   1. Organization Wide Deafults [Users excluding the System Admin]  
   ---> So when we want that a particular user (configure record level security) should see only his recods then go to 'Sharing setting' and also if
      someone exteranal wants the access to a records of an object.
      And Set the Visibility of the record to 'private'.
   
   2. Role Hierarchy
   ---> A manager can access a sub-ordinate's records.
  
   3. Sharing Rule
   ---> Used to share records based on a certain criteria or ownership.[creating rules for sharing records on basis of criteria or owner of the record].
   Go to Sharing Setting.
  
   4. Manual Sharing 
   ---> A user can share his own records to anyone through Manual Sharing.

- Permission Set Groups 

 ---> It is used to create a group of permission sets and all the combined permissions are granted to the group.

- Public Group 

 ---> It is collection of users or groups.eg) Group of librarians in the library.

- Queues

 ---> A queue of users. and associate object with the queue. eg) Customers raise request to the customer services(Case Object record is created) here
      customer executives answer the calls.So executives are associated with the Case record of customers in queue.
 
 ---> [Places where queues can be used] Web Queue and Email Queue is used to create a Case.[Service Cloud Part].

- Setup Audit Taril 
 
 ---> Used to see the time and chengeds done on the Setup page[Logs of activity on setup screen].

- Login Access Policies 

 ---> It is used to give login access to System admin and Organizations.

- Login History 

 ---> Keeps logs of Who and Which User logged in Which account in Org.

==================================================================================================================================

- Process Automation[Business] 

 Q) What is a process?
 ---> A process is a sequence of steps which leads to outcome.
 Q)What are the tools available?
 ---> Approval process
    --> Applying for a leave
    --> Applying for a loan at a bank
 ---> Workflow (outdated)
 ---> Process Builder(retire by 2023)
 ---> Flow(Future)

 ---> Approval process
    --> Search for Approval process two options available 
      1. Use jump Start wizard - fastest creation.(few questions asked)
      2. Use Standard Setup wizard - standard creation (lot of questions asked)
    --> We send a request and the delegated approver will approve our request so we have this many options 1 and 2.
    --> Approval Action and Rejection actions are applied and work after these actions are executed completely.
    --> Final Approval and Rejection actions used when multiple users are required for approaval and take action after completely executed of actions.
    --> Recall actions are used to undo and correct the wrong rquest raised even after submitted state.
        It unlocks the record for editing.

- Process Bulider

 ---> Search for Process Builder.
 ---> We will implement Lead Conversion Process.(Lead is standard object) name of some person or individual.
  i.e all the opportunities or project which the company gets through its eg)home page, will be created as lead record.
  Opportunity means an offer to do business with existing client.
 ---> Lead Conversion - Converting a Lead into account and opportunity.


====================================================================================================================================

- Flow 

---> We can call autolaunch flow from the 1)apex classes 2)Process Builder. 
---> To create record of book_copy(which has a master detail relationship with book) the relationship field(here book_copy) has to be initialized first.
we can't leave it blank.


---> Then assignment of book quantity to variable(creating it).
---> Then decision operation and checking condition over there.
---> And then depending according to the decision operation we create a record.

---> Assignments are not for declaring statements its wrong assumption.
we first declare the variable and then perform assignment on that.

---> In flow if we go to actions then in apex action we can call apex method if that method is static and anotated with invokable anotation.
---> We can also call object specific actions from flow.
---> We can call flows and they are the autolaunch flows.

---> Looping element is used for looping but these are not the for,while loop keep in mind.They are more similar to for each loop.
They are used to iterate over arrays,collections only.

- Creating Flow which can be called from Process Builder

--> Declare a variable so that it can trigger the Process Builder which will call the flow.As the flow will associate the book_copy record with the book record we have to pass the
book record id from process to flow because flow doesn't know it as it is indirectly called i.e from process builder and not from record creation of book record.
---> Then get the records and store them in variables.
---> Then assignment of book quantity to variable(creating it).
---> Then decision operation and checking condition over there.
---> And then depending according to the decision operation we create a record copy.
---> Then reducing the book quantity.And connect this stage to the decision stage to form a loop.

---> Now create a process in process builder so it will call the flow.
---> In this when we create a process we can set flow variables whoes 'Available for Input' is checked [Under the Availability outside the flow].

Note : Unless the flow is not activated it will not be visible to process in the Process Builder.

- Availability for input means it can be initialized from outside the flow when a process builder call a flow.
- Availability for output means it can be accessed from outside the flow when a process builder call a flow.[Mostly useful in Subflow scenarios i.e when we want to access variables values of subflow from  parent flow]

---> Record data type is used to store and retrive Record variables.

======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

 June 6 2nd Lecture

- Data Management

---> Data Management is about managing data i.e import and export of data in the org.

- Tools for data management 

---> There are three tools for data management 

1. Data Import Wizard
2. Data Export 
3. Data Loader [Has an advantage over Data import wizard on supporting number of objects].

1. Data Import Wizard

---> Search for Data Import Wizard in quick search.
---> Upload data in CSV format.Clean up the data i.e only valid data should be present in excel sheet and no error.
---> Our Field names matches the Salesforce fields name.
---> Don't import too many record at once.

---> It supports a limited number of standard objects and all custom objects created by us.
   Match Account Name <-- field
---> Here the SalesforceID.com means the account id records.<--- Value.
---> It data import limit is Max 50000 records.
---> Update Existing Account Information
This option is used to update information in Account when another column is present which contains information regarding account other than contact.

---> Trigger workflow rules and processes
This option is used when we want the automatic Processes[Process builder] or flows for contact/Account object to be triggered automatically.

NOTE : A lot of Salesforce Developer will recommend to not to select this option.[Reason: if something goes wrong in flows/processes then it will hamper the import operation]

2. Data Export 
 
---> In this we can export data and we have to schedule data export time and details or we can export it right now also.
After the scheduled export is completed we will receive an email alert and we can download the exported data.
---> In developers Edition we can export only once in 29 days.

3. Data Loader [This tool is used for importing as well as exporting]

---> Its a Java Tool. 
---> Upsert means either insert or update.
---> So if we want to add filter like SOQL Query on data import or export then use the Data Loader. 
---> The limit for data export for Data Loader is Max 5 million records.
---> If we use the delete operation then success and  error files are created at the specified directory.

---> Don't Use Workbench in live projects as its not a official tool by salesforce.
[Used like SQl for query execution,data operation and so on].

- Reports

---> Graphical representation of data in your org is called reports.
---> We can remove columns and rows from the left side of the report page.

- Report Types

---> It is used to decide which objects (and related object) and their fields will be available in the report. 
---> Search for report type in quick search and create a report type.
---> If report type is already created for an object then we can directly make its report.
---> If while creating custom object if we select the 'Allow Request' optional feature then while creation/configuration of object the salesforce
simulthanously creates an report type of the object. 

---> If we create record types using two primary and secondary object objects then the report created by them 
will have access to both records of the objects.i.e we can use both the records of primary and secondary object on that report.
---> We can create report type of only primary object as well as report type of primary and secondary object also.

---> Record Types is also used to decide the records of the object that will be available in the report.
---> After making report if i want to show it to my team members/specific users so i should create a folder so that it will easy for me to share it to other team members.
---> We can configure columns also by using filters on the left side.
---> Current FQ --> Current financial Quater.If the record satisfies Current FQ then it will be displayed in the list on beside it.
---> In tabular report we cannot add Charts.
---> We can use group option to group records by rows and columns.[Use charts when grouping is done].
---> Fiscal Period --> financial Period.When we group the report by column and rows it becomes Matrix Report.
---> We can join two report types also eg)Opportunity and Case by using the choose format option in the reptort button on the left upper corner in the report
page here though they do not have any relation with each other but they both have relationship with Accounts object.
---> We can also group Across blocks i.e Blocks of Opportunity and Case by using the Account Name as it is the common between them.

- Dashboard

---> Collection of reports.
---> These are used to group reports so it becomes easy for us to analyze the reports.
---> They are stored in the folders and we can share these folders with other users as well. 
---> We can display Dashboard on Homepage also by editing the Home Page.
---> There are many backend changes in the data and if you want to keep your Dashboard Updated then subscribe it so it will get refreshed everytime when there 
is changes in the backend.
---> If we edit the Dashboard then we can configure it in such a way that different will be shown different Data by using the 'View Dashboard As' Option.
