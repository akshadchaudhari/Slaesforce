- Primary Key Constrainst -
1. Is a column or Coumn combination in a table used to uniquely identify a each row in a table.
2. It is a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraint.
3. Only one primary key per table is allowed.
4. Acts as a unique identifier for each row.
5. Oracle server creates unique index when a primary key is created.
6. NOT NULL constraint is automatically applied on the column which has primary key on it.
7. Two types of primary keys 
i. Simple Primary key (Single column)
eg) (manager id NUMBER CONSTRAINT PK_MANAGER PRIMARY KEY,
     ------- 
     -------
    );
ii.Composite Primary key(Multiple/(Table Level) Columns)
    (manager_id NUMBER,
     ------- 
     CONSTRAINT PK_MANAGER PRIMARY KEY(manager_id)
    );

- Constraint names should be unique for a schema i.e we cannot create same constraint name for a schema and other also.

- Foriegn Key Constraint (Child)-
1. It is a column or combination of columns which is used to show relationship between parent and child tables.
2. Relationship is between the primary/unique key of parent table and column or set of columns of the child table.
3. Also called referential integrity constraint i.e it creates link between two tables and enforces data integrity by restricting the data that can be entered.
4. A reference record should be availabe in the Parent table(Primary key) before we insert a record related to it in the child table(foreign key).
5. To delete the records of the parent we first need to delete the same record from the child table.
6. A single column(child table) when references to single column in parent table is called simple foreign key.
   And when multiple column(child table)when references to multiple columns in parent table is called composite  foriegn key.
7.References keyword is used to table name and column name to be referenced in the parent table.
eg) CONSTRAINT mgr_dept_fk REFERENCES departmens(department_id),--> column level foriegn key.
CONSTRAINT mgr_dept_fk FOREIGN KEY(manager_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id) --> Table level foreign key.

***** Important Note ******
1. While creating copy of the table using create tables,select statements ,only NOT NULL constraints will be copied from the original table.
As the database should know where to point.
2. Cannot delete parent record while child record references it.

8. We cannot set child record to any value other than the parent table has,But the NULL value is exception even if the parent record doesn't have NULL values.
9. Foriegn key composite key will point to composite primary key only and not the simple primary key. 

- TO OVERCOME INTEGRITY CONSTRAINT PROBLEMS -
- Deleting parent and child record problems  these clauses are introduced.


- ON DELETE CASCADE -
1. This clause deletes dependent rows in the child table where a related row in the parent table is deleted.

- ON DELETE SET NULL -
1. This clause upadtes dependent rows in the child table to NULL when a related row in the parent table  is deleted.

****NOTE****
- This clauses are only applicable to Table-Level Constraints Only.

- CHECK Constraint -
1. Ensures a column or a group of columns to meet a specific condition.
2. used in arithmetic and conditional operations.
3. Cannot create check constraint referencing to another table.
4. Can be applied on table-level as well as column-level constraint.
5. A table or a column can hav multiple check constraints.
eg) CHECK(department_id IN(10,20,30,40)), --> column level Constraint
CONSTRAINT mgr_salary_check CHECK(salary>0 AND salary<100000) --> Table-level Constraint.

-->They enforce rules at the table level.

2.What is true about NOT NULL constraint in SQL?
